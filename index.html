      The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War â€“ Part 2,
      but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as
      directors in <i>April 2015</i>, with Markus and McFeely signing on to
      write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the
      story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main
      characters. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in
      Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and
      ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the
      <i>Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, New York, Scotland, and England</i>.
      The story revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back
      actors and settings from throughout the franchise as well as music from
      previous films. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an
      estimated budget of $356 million, it is one of the most expensive films
      ever made.
